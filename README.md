# Laser-Slope-Sensing-and-Mapping-Including-UAV-Attitude

Because of the difference in the laser sensor, there will be some error in measuring the distance. In order to minimize the error and enhance the stability, a sliding mean filter is applied to the distance measured by the sensor and a Kalman filter is applied to the final calculated angle.
